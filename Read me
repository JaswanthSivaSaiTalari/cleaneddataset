Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Elevate Labs Internship
This repository contains the solution to Task 1 for the Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs. The project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw marketing dataset.

Dataset
Filename: marketing_campaign.csv

Source: Provided as part of Elevate Labs internship task materials.

Records: 2240 rows, 29 columns (raw data)

Cleaned Dataset: marketing_campaign_cleaned.csv

Task Overview
The objective is to clean and standardize the dataset by:

Removing missing values and duplicate rows

Standardizing categorical text fields (e.g., education, marital status)

Unifying date formats (e.g., customer join date)

Cleaning and formatting column headers

Ensuring all data types are correct for each field

Methodology
Data Loading: Raw data loaded and inspected for column structure and types.

Duplicate Removal: All duplicate rows checked and removed—none were found in this dataset.

Missing Data: Rows with missing values in any field were dropped, resulting in 24 fewer rows.

Text Standardization: All categorical text fields (like education, marital status) converted to lowercase and stripped for consistency.

Date Formatting: All dates formatted as dd-mm-yyyy.

Column Formatting: All columns renamed to be lowercase, separated by underscores for easier processing.

Type Conversion: Each column’s data type was enforced according to content — e.g., IDs and counts as integers, income as float, dates as strings in unified format.

Deliverables

Results
Final cleaned dataset shape: 2216 rows x 29 columns

All dates and text standardized

All column names and types unified and tidy

Sample of clean data:
id	year_birth	education	marital_status	income	dt_customer	...
5524	1957	graduation	single	58138.0	04-09-2012	...
2174	1954	graduation	single	46344.0	08-03-2014	...
4141	1965	graduation	together	71613.0	21-08-2013	...
Usage
Use the cleaned CSV for further data analysis, reporting, or modeling. All major cleaning steps and decisions are documented in the code and in this README.
